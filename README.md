# Hide YouTube Shorts List

A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to hide all traces of YouTube shorts videos.

This filter list might work with other content blockers, but I haven't looked into that (yet).

Copy the link below, go to uBlock Origin > Dashboard > Filters and paste the link underneath the 'Import...' heading:
