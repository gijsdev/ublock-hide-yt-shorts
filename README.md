# Hide YouTube Shorts List

A [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) filter list to remove youtube shorts from youtube on desktop and mobile.

This probably works with ad block plus, Ad Guard, or any other blocker that uses blocklists with APB or EasyList filter syntax. This has only been tested with uBlock Origin.

Follow the uBlock Origin documentation on adding [3rd-party-filter-lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists) and add the URL below:

This has been shamelessly forked from gijsdev and the mobile rules have been shamelessly copied from MrXTheAnon.
